# IBM-ReactJS-Fetch-Data-Using-UseFetch
### What I learnt
In this lab, I learnt how to fetch data in React using a custom hook (UseFetch) and a corresponding component (FetchData). By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, I improved code maintainability. I mastered React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and asynchronous operations efficiently. Additionally, I learnt to dynamically render fetched data on the UI with JSX, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
### Learning objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:
- Fetch data from an external API using the fetch API method within a React application.
- Implement a custom React hook (UseFetch) to encapsulate the logic to fetch data.
- Render the data retrieved from the API onto the UI and display relevant information such as name, importance, benefits, and the best time to intake for each item.
